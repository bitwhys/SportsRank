See full report () about PageRank background and model results.


Googleâ€™s [PageRank algorithm]() allows efficient ranking of webpages by creating a directed graph of the web. By considering each webpage a node and hyperlinks as the arcs, the resulting Markov matrix provides the left steady-state eigenvector; this PageRank vector provides the relative probabilities each webpage, and thus a ranking. PageRank provides a ranking of a complex network using a single measure, the number and direction of hyperlinks. SportsRank applies this model to athletics, demonstrated here with the NBA.
